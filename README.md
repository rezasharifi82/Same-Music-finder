simple python code to find same music tracks based on their time and their size.
# Dependency: mutagen library
### in this code you can simply find all same musics in a folder based on their time
  You can use this code to find all same musics in a directory and its subs.
  The "path" variable is the only thing that you should change in code.
  After that, you can run the code and decide what you want to delete.
  I should also mention that, you have to type the number of your option in order to delete it successfully.(either 1 or 2)
